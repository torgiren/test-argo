  # Any name can be used here

spec:
  # This can be a HTTPS or git URL.  If you are using a git URL then
  # clientSecretName will probably need to be set to supply a credential.
  # repo is the only required parameter for a repo to be monitored.
  #
  repo: https://github.com/torgiren/test-argo

  # Enforce all resources go to this target namespace. If a cluster scoped
  # resource is found the deployment will fail.
  #
  targetNamespace: kube-system

  # Any branch can be watched, this field is optional. If not specified the
  # branch is assumed to be master
  #
  # branch: master

  # A specific commit or tag can also be watched.
  #
  # revision: v0.3.0

  # For a private registry you must supply a clientSecretName. A default
  # secret can be set at the namespace level using the BundleRestriction
  # type. Secrets must be of the type "kubernetes.io/ssh-auth" or
  # "kubernetes.io/basic-auth". The secret is assumed to be in the
  # same namespace as the GitRepo
  #
  # clientSecretName: my-ssh-key
  #
  # If fleet.yaml contains a private Helm repo that requires authentication,
  # provide the credentials in a K8s secret and specify them here. Details are provided
  # in the fleet.yaml documentation.
  #
  # helmSecretName: my-helm-secret
  #
  # To add additional ca-bundle for self-signed certs, caBundle can be
  # filled with base64 encoded pem data. For example:
  # `cat /path/to/ca.pem | base64 -w 0`
  #
  # caBundle: my-ca-bundle
  #
  # Disable SSL verification for git repo
  #
  # insecureSkipTLSVerify: true
  #
  # A git repo can read multiple paths in a repo at once.
  # The below field is expected to be an array of paths and
  # supports path globbing (ex: some/*/path)
  #
  # Example:
  # paths:
  # - single-path
  # - multiple-paths/*
  paths:
    - word3
